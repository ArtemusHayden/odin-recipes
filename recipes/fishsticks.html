    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p> Fish Sticks are fun. This homemade, oven-baked version is 
        crispy, tender, flaky, and so delicious! Strips of fish are 
        covered in bread crumbs and baked to perfection in this 
        kid-friendly recipe. They make for a simple family dinner, or 
        they can be served as an appetizer or even at a party. And don't 
        forget the homemade tartar sauce for dipping, and fries for the 
        perfect side.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon lemon-pepper seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>3/4 pound cod fillets, cut into 1-inch strips</li>
        <li>Butter-flavored cooking spray</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400Â°. In a shallow bowl, mix bread crumbs and 
            seasonings. Place flour and egg in separate shallow bowls. Dip 
            fish in flour to coat both sides; shake off excess. Dip in egg,
            then in crumb mixture, patting to help coating adhere.</li>
        <li>
            Place on a baking sheet coated with cooking spray; spritz fish 
            with butter-flavored cooking spray. Bake 10-12 minutes or until 
            fish just begins to flake easily with a fork, turning once.
